## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#install.packages("calendR")
library(calendR)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
calendar <- calendR(year = 2024, month = 9, special.days = c(5, 10, 12, 19, 23), special.col = "lightblue",text = c("Hot Chocolate", "Paint and Pass", "", "Event 4", "Event 5"), text.pos = c(5, 10, 12, 19, 23), text.size = 4)
calendar

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
